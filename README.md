## About this Project

This application is split between 3 main pages.
* Dashboard - Shows a summary off the number of tasks, total products and total inventory value
* Tasks - This page consists of a modern table with a search bar. Here the owner can create/view/edit/delete tasks. They can also search through the tasks.
* Products - This page consists of a modern table with a search bar for products. The summary of the products is shown in each row such as name, description, price. The owner can view the product and see more details regarding their product along with having an option to Create/View/Edit/Delete them. This table can also be searched through to make finding the specific product as efficiently as possible.
* Extras: Home page, Login & Register pages and profile settings.

This project was completed in my final year of University for the Advanced Web Engineering Module. It took two sprints to complete following the SCRUM Framework and at the end of each sprint a Retrospective was completed.

However, to refresh my memory I am recreating the application I had created previously and improving upon it.

## Features this Application has used:

* MVC
* Routes
* Database & Migrations
* Factories & Seeders
* Laravel Jetstream for Authentication
* Tailwind CSS for greater variety on CSS
* Blade Templating Engine
